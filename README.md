# CSS-Engine
engine.css is a tiny utility CSS engine that lets you use classes like mt-40 or px-16 without shipping thousands of styles. You add only the values you need, and the engine does the math. Works with any project, stays super light, and keeps your CSS clean without the Tailwind-style bloat.
